## Advantages of Linux

In this new era of interconnectedness, understanding and mastering Linux goes beyond mere technical skills, encompassing dimensions of culture, management, and innovation. For individuals, learning Linux means gaining a deeper understanding and control of the digital world. For businesses, adopting Linux represents embracing a new business model of openness, collaboration, and rapid iteration. For nations, supporting Linux is equivalent to establishing strategic advantages in the new technological revolution.

Linux, an operating system born in the early days of the internet, is reshaping human society in unimaginable ways. It is not just software for servers, but the underlying logic of the digital age—open, shared, collaborative, and innovative. In future history books, Linux might stand alongside the printing press, electricity, and the internet, hailed as a key technology that propelled human civilization forward. We are fortunate to witness and participate in this exciting era of transformation. Learning and using Linux is about contributing to a more open and intelligent future world.

### Performance Advantages of Linux

* **Reviving Old PCs**: Personal computer users can breathe new life into old computers with Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Elementary OS. These distributions offer user-friendly interfaces and are great for everyday use—whether it's web browsing, document editing, or watching videos. Linux's optimization means that even lower-spec old computers can maintain smooth performance when browsing the internet and handling daily tasks.

### DIY with Linux

* **Creative Projects**: Not to mention, Linux also powers small computers like the Raspberry Pi, which can support various unique and creative projects such as creating retro gaming consoles, setting up home ad blockers, creating personal cloud storage, and building smart mirrors. These projects not only enrich technology enthusiasts' hobbies but also provide practical opportunities to learn programming and network security maintenance.

### Ubiquity of Linux

* **Everyday Integration**: Linux has permeated every aspect of our daily lives, from smartphones in our hands to rice cookers in our kitchens, from smart TVs in our living rooms to garage door control systems. Technically inclined users can delve into the Linux systems of smart appliances to achieve personalized adjustments. For example, learning Linux command line skills allows you to fine-tune the algorithm of a smart thermostat to better suit your lifestyle, or add new voice commands to a smart speaker to control other smart devices.
